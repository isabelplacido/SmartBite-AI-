        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension are tightly linked to what people
            eat every day. A lot of products that look harmless on the shelf are actually ultra-processed and
            loaded with added sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Nutrition labels are confusing and time-consuming
            to read, so most people just guess and move on.
        </p>
        <p>
            These small, fast decisions in the grocery aisle, at vending machines, or on delivery apps slowly
            add up and increase long-term health risk, especially for young adults who are just building their
            habits.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Expecting everyone to count calories, track macros, and analyze ingredients for every meal is
            unrealistic. What would help more is a simple signal about food quality that fits into the way
            people already behave: scrolling, snapping pictures, and tapping once for feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea behind SmartBite AI is to explore whether computer vision can provide that signal.
            Instead of manually logging foods, a user could take a quick photo of a product and get a
            coarse judgment of how health-supporting it is.

        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <p>
            This project builds a small image classifier that groups food items into three broad categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh</strong> – foods that are closer to whole or minimally processed items.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed</strong> – foods that combine fresh and processed elements or are more neutral.</li>
            <li><strong>Ultraprocessed</strong> – highly processed snacks or products with many added ingredients.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The goal is not to give medical advice or exact nutrition scores. Instead, this is a proof-of-concept:
            can a deep learning model like AlexNet (and a more modern ResNet18) learn useful visual patterns from
            a small custom dataset and separate these three categories at all?
        </p>

        <h2>Goals of This Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prototype an image-based “food awareness” tool with three health-related classes.</li>
            <li>Adapt a pretrained AlexNet model to a new dataset of food images.</li>
            <li>Run controlled experiments with batch size, learning rate, augmentation, and architecture.</li>
            <li>Evaluate performance limits on a small dataset and reflect on what would be needed in real life.</li>
        </ul>
