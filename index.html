        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease are strongly linked to diet.
            Many people, especially young adults, eat ultra-processed foods without realizing the long-term risks.
            Nutrition labels are confusing, and most apps focus on calories instead of food quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            SmartBite AI aims to help users quickly understand whether a food choice is likely to support or harm
            their long-term health, using an image of the product as input.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>High rates of obesity and chronic disease are often driven by daily food decisions.</li>
            <li>People make choices in seconds at the grocery store or on delivery apps.</li>
            <li>Manual tracking is tedious; an image-based AI assistant could make awareness almost automatic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project explores whether a classic convolutional neural network (AlexNet) can be adapted to classify
            food images into health-related categories, as a small first step toward that kind of assistant.
